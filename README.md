### My First Steps
- The first thing I have done is created a script that be ran upon deployment of EC2 instance. This script will install tools and services needed for the project (SonarQube, Jenkins, Grafana). 
- Next, I decided to configure my AWS environment using IaC (Terraform), this template allows for automation when deploying resources in the future. 
### Current Status
- Terraform file under maintenance.
